  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/fsharp-events/index.html">Upcoming F# events - learn Suave, FsLab & more!</a></h1>
  <p>Some people in the F# community have reputation for traveling too much. I do not know how that is
possible, but as it happens, I will be visiting a couple of places in June and doing a number of
talks, workshops and courses. So, if you are thinking about getting into F#, web development with
F# using the <a href="http://suave.io">amazing Suave library</a>, playing with the new trendy F# to JavaScript
compiler <a href="http://fsprojects.github.io/Fable">called Fable</a>, or learning about the recent
features in <a href="https://twitter.com/fslaborg/status/728397249697488896">FsLab and Ionide</a>, then
continue reading!</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/fsharp-events/map.png" style="margin:0px 5% 20px 5%; width:90%" />

<p>The map includes all my travels, but not all of the pins are for F# events. I'm visiting Prague
just to see my family (even though there is a <a href="http://www.fsharping.cz">new awesome F# meetup there</a>)
and my stop in Paris is attending <a href="http://www.hapoc.org/hapop3">Symposium for the History and Philosophy of
Programming</a> (although we might still do something with the local F#
group too).</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/philopl-questions/index.html">Philosophical questions about programming</a></h1>
  <p>Combining philosophy and computer science might appear a bit odd. The disciplines have very little
overlap. Both philosophers and computer scientists get taught formal logic at some point in their
undergraduate courses, but that's probably as close as they get.</p>

<p>But the fact that the disciplines do not overlap much might very well be the reason why putting them
together is interesting. In an article about <a href="http://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/designandscience">Design and Science</a>,
Joichi Ito (from MIT Media Lab), describes the term <em>antidisciplinary</em> and nicely
summarizes why looking at such unusual combinations is worthwhile:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interdisciplinary work is when people from different disciplines work together. But
<em>antidisciplinary</em> is something very different; it's about working in spaces that
simply do not fit into any existing academic discipline.</p>

  <p>[When focusing on disciplines, it] takes more and more effort and resources to make a
unique contribution. While the space between and beyond the disciplines can be academically
risky, it (...) requires fewer resources to try promising, unorthodox
approaches; and provides the potential to have tremendous impact (...).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see from some of my <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/tag/philosophy/">earlier blog posts</a>,
I think the space between philosophy and computer science is an interesting area. In this article,
I'll explain why. Unlike some of the previous posts (about <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/failures/index.html">miscomputation</a>,
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/against-types/index.html">types</a> and <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/philosophy-pl/index.html">philosophy of
science</a>), this post is quite broad and
does not go into much detail.</p>

<p>At the danger of sounding like a collection of random rants, I look at a number of
questions that arise when you look at computer science from the philosophical perspective,
but I won't attempt to answer them. You can see this article as a research proposal too -
and I hope to write more about some of the questions in the future.
I wish antidisciplinary work was more common and I believe looking
into such questions could have the tremendous impact that Joichi Ito mentioned.</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2016/coeffects-playground/index.html">Coeffects playground: Interactive essay based on my PhD thesis</a></h1>
  <p>In my <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/theses/coeffects/">PhD thesis</a>, I worked on integrating
<em>contextual information</em> into a type system of functional programming languages. For example,
say your mobile application accesses something from the environment such as GPS sensor or your
Facebook friends. With <em>coeffects</em>, this could be a part of the type. Rather than having type
<code>string -&gt; Person</code>, the type of a function would also include resources and would be
<code>string -{ gps, fb }-&gt; Person</code>. I wrote <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/why-coeffects-matter/">longer introduction to coeffects</a> on this
blog before.</p>

<p>As one might expect, the PhD thesis is more theoretical and it looks at other kinds of contextual
information (e.g. past values in stream-based data-flow programming) and it identifies abstract
<em>coeffect algebra</em> that captures the essence of contextual information that can be nicely tracked
in a functional language.</p>

<p>I always thought that the most interesting thing about the thesis is that it gives people a nice way
to think about <em>context</em> in a unified way. Sadly, the very theoretical presentation in the thesis
makes this quite hard for those who are not doing programming language theory.</p>

<p>To make it a bit easier to explore the ideas behind coeffects, I wrote a coeffect playground
that runs in a web browser and lets you learn about coeffects, play with two example context-aware languages,
run a couple of demos and learn more about how the theory works. Go <a href="http://tomasp.net/coeffects/">check it out now</a>
or continue below to learn more about some interesting internals!</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/happy-new-year-tweets/index.html">Happy New Year 2016 around the World</a></h1>
  <p>Just like <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/composing-christmas/">last year</a> and the 
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2013/japan-advent-art/index.html">year</a> 
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/japan-advent-art-en/">before</a>, I wanted to participate in the
<a href="https://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/2015/10/25/f-advent-calendar-in-english-2015/">#FsAdvent</a>
event, where someone writes a blog post about something they did with F# during December. 
Thanks to <a href="https://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/">Sergey Tihon</a> for the organization of the English
version and the <a href="http://connpass.com/event/22056/">Japanese F# community</a> for coming up with the 
idea a few years ago!</p>

<p>As my blog post ended up on 31 December, I wanted to do something that would fit well with the
theme of ending of 2015 and starting of the new year 2016 and so I decided to write a little 
interactive web site that tracks the "Happy New Year" tweets live across the globe. This is
partly inspired by <a href="http://twitter.github.io/interactive/newyear2014/">Happy New Year Tweets</a>
from Twitter in 2014, but rather than analyzing data in retrospect, you can watch 2016 come live!</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/reading-list/index.html">Philosophy of science books every computer scientist should read</a></h1>
  <p>When I tell my fellow computer scientists or software developers that I'm interested in 
<em>philosophy of science</em>, they first look a bit confused, then we have a really interesting 
discussion about it and then they ask me for some interesting books they could read about it.
Given that Christmas is just around the corner and some of the readers might still be looking
for a good present to get, I thought that now is the perfect time to turn my answer into a
blog post!</p>

<p>So, what is philosophy of science about? In summary, it is about trying to better understand 
science. I'll keep using the word <em>science</em> here, but I think <em>engineering</em> would work equally
well. As someone who recently spent a couple of years doing a PhD on programming language theory,
I find this extremely important for computer science (and programming). How can we make better
programming languages if we do not know what <em>better</em> means? And what do we mean when we talk
about very basic concepts like <em>types</em> or programming <em>errors</em>?</p>

<p>Reading about philosophy of science inspired me to write a couple of essays on some of the 
topics above including <a href="/blog/2014/philosophy-pl/">What can programming language research learn from the philosophy of science?</a> and two essays that discuss the <a href="/blog/2015/against-types/">nature of types in programming languages</a> and also
the nature of <a href="/blog/2015/failures/">errors and miscomputations</a>. This blog post lists some of
the interesting books that I've read and that influenced my thinking (not just) when writing the
aforementioned essays.</p>

<p>I was fortunate enough to make it to the Microsoft MVP summit this year. I didn't learn anything 
secret (and even if I did, I wouldn't tell you!) but one thing I did learn is that there is a lot
of interest in data science and machine learning both inside Microsoft and in the MVP community.
What was less expected and more exciting was that there was also a lot of interest in F#, which 
is a perfect fit for both of these topics!</p>

<p>When I visited Microsoft back in May to talk about <a href="http://tpetricek.github.io/Talks/2015/scalable-ml-ds-fsharp/redmond/">Scalable Machine Learning and Data Science 
with F#</a> at an internal event, 
I ended up chatting with the organizer about F# and we agreed that it would be nice to do more
on F#, which is how we ended up organizing the <a href="http://fsharpworks.com/mvp-summit/2015.html">F# + ML |&gt; MVP Summit 2015</a>
mini-conference on the Friday after the summit.</p>

<p>There are huge amounts of data around us that we could use to better understand the world.
Every company collects large amounts of data about their sales or customers. Governments and
international organizations increasingly release interesting data sets to the public through
various <em>open government data</em> initiatives (<a href="http://data.gov">data.gov</a> or 
<a href="http://data.gov.uk">data.gov.uk</a>). But raw data does not tell you much.</p>

<p>An interesting recent development is <em>data journalism</em>. Data journalists tell stories using
data. A data driven article is based on an interesting observation from the data, it includes
(interactive) visualizations that illustrate the point and it often allows the reader to get
the raw data.</p>

<p>Adding a chart produced in, say, Excel to an article is easy, but building good interactive
visualization is much harder. Ideally, the data driven article should not be just text with
static pictures, but a <em>program</em> that links the original data source to the visualization.
This lets readers explore how the data is used, update the content when new data is available
and change parameters of the visualization if they need to understand different aspect of the
topic.</p>

<p>This is in short what I'm trying to build with <a href="http://thegamma.net">The Gamma project</a>. If
you're interested in building better reports or data driven articles, continue reading!</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/fssnip-suave/index.html">Creating web sites with Suave: How to contribute to F# Snippets</a></h1>
  <img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/fssnip-suave/logo.png" style="width:130px;float:right;margin-left:10px" />

<p>The core of many web sites and web APIs is very simple. Given an HTTP request,
produce a HTTP response. In F#, we can represent this as a function with type
<code>Request -&gt; Response</code>. To make our server scalable, we should make the function
<em>asynchronous</em> to avoid unnecessary blocking of threads. In F#, this can be 
captured as <code>Request -&gt; Async&lt;Response&gt;</code>. Sounds pretty simple, right? So why 
are there so many <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/library-frameworks/">evil frameworks</a>
that make simple web programming difficult?</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is a nice F# library called <a href="http://suave.io">Suave.io</a> that 
is based exactly on the above idea:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suave is a simple web development F# library providing a lightweight web server 
and a set of combinators to manipulate route flow and task composition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I recently decided to start a new version of the <a href="http://www.fssnip.net">F# Snippets</a>
web site and I wanted to keep the implementation functional, simple, 
cross-platform and easy to contrbute to. I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/FsSnip.Website/">first prototype of the 
implementation</a> using Suave and 
already received a few contributions via pull requests! In this blog post, I'll
share a few interesting aspects of the implementation and I'll give you some
good pointers where you can learn more about Suave. <em>There is no excuse for not
contributing to F# Snippets v2 after reading this blog post</em>!</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/typed-revisited/index.html">In the age of the web: Typed functional-first programming revisited</a></h1>
  <p>Most programming languages were designed before the age of web.
This matters because the web changes many assumptions that typed functional 
language designers tak for granted. For example, programs do not run in a 
<em>closed world</em>, but must instead interact with (changing and likely unreliable) 
services and data sources, communication is often asynchronous or event-driven, 
and programs need to interoperate with untyped environments like JavaScript
libraries.</p>

<p>How can statically-typed programming languages adapt to the modern world?
In this article, I look at one possible answer that is inspired by the F# 
language and various F# libraries. In F#, we use <em>type providers</em> for 
integration with external information sources and for integration with untyped
programming environments. We use <em>lightweight meta-programming</em> for targeting 
JavaScript and <em>computation expressions</em> for writing asynchronous code.</p>

<p>This blog post is a shorter version of a <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/age-of-web/">ML workshop paper</a>
that I co-authored earlier this year and you should see this more as a position
statement. I'm not sure if F# and the solutions shown here are the best ones,
but I think they highlight very important questions in programming language 
design that I very much see as unsolved.</p>

<p>The article has two sections. First, I'll go through a simple case study showing
how F# can be used to build a client-side web widget. Then, I'll discuss some
of the implications for programming language design based on the example.</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/failures/index.html">Miscomputation: Learning to live with errors</a></h1>
  <blockquote>
<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/failures/babbage.png" style="float:right;width:110px;margin:5px 0px 10px 20px" />

<p style="margin-bottom:5px">If trials of three or four simple cases have been made, and are found
to agree with the results given by the engine, it is scarcely possible that there can be any error
(...).</p>
<p style="text-align:right">Charles Babbage, On the mathematical<br /> powers of the calculating engine (1837)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anybody who has something to do with modern computers will agree that the above statement made by
Charles Babbage about the analytical engine is understatement, to say the least.</p>

<p>Computer programs do not always work as expected. There is a complex taxonomy of errors or
<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-013-0112-0"><em>miscomputations</em></a>. The taxonomy of
possible errors is itself interesting. Syntax errors like missing semicolons are quite obvious
and are easy to catch. Logical errors are harder to find, but at least we know that something
went wrong. For example, our algorithm does not correctly sort some lists. There are also issues that
may or may not be actual errors. For example an algorithm in online store might suggest slightly
suspicious products. Finally, we also have concurrency errors that happen very rarely in some
very specific scenario.</p>

<p>If Babbage was right, we would just try three or four simple cases and eradicate all errors from
our programs, but eliminating errors is not so easy. In retrospect, it is quite interesting to
see how long it took early computer engineers to realise that coding (i.e. translating
mathematical algorithm to program code) errors are a problem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="margin-bottom:5px">Errors in coding were only gradually recognized to be a signiﬁcant
problem: a typical early comment was that of Miller [circa 1949], who wrote that such errors,
along with hardware faults, could be "expected, in time, to become infrequent".</p>
<p style="text-align:right">Mark Priestley, Science of Operations (2011)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We <em>mostly</em> got rid of hardware faults, but coding errors are still here. Programmers spent
over 50 years finding different practical strategies for dealing with them. In this
blog post, I want to look at four of the strategies. Quite curiously, there is a very wide range.</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/fslab-world-visualization/index.html">Visualizing interesting world facts with FsLab</a></h1>
  <p>In case you missed my recent <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/announcing-fslab/">official FsLab announcement</a>, 
FsLab is a data-science package for .NET built around F# that makes it easy to get data using <em>type providers</em>, 
analyze them interactively (with great R integration) and visualize the results. You can find more on
on <a href="http://fslab.org">fslab.org</a>, which also has links to <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Understanding-the-World-with-F">some</a>
<a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/dotnetConf/2015/The-F-Path-to-Data-Scripting-Nirvana">videos</a> and
<a href="http://fslab.org/download/">download page with templates</a> and other instructions.</p>

<p>Last time, I mentioned that we are working on integrating FsLab with the <a href="http://tahahachana.github.io/XPlot/">XPlot charting 
library</a>. XPlot is a wonderful F# library built by 
<a href="https://twitter.com/TahaHachana">Taha Hachana</a> that wraps two powerful HTML5 visualization libraries - 
<a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/">Google Charts</a> and <a href="https://plot.ly/">plot.ly</a>.</p>

<p>I thought I'd see what interesting visualizations I can built with XPlot, so I opened the <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/WorldBank.html">World Bank type
provider</a> to get some data about the world
and Euro area, to make the blog post relevant to what is happening in the world today.</p>

<p>Programming languages are a fascinating area because they combine computer science (and logic) with
many other disciplines including <a href="http://lmeyerov.github.io/projects/socioplt/viz/index.html">sociology</a>, <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1415/P201/">human computer interaction</a> and things
that cannot be scientifically quantified like intuition, taste and (for better or worse) politics.</p>

<p>When we talk about programming languages, we often treat it mainly as scientific discussion seeking
some objective truth. This is not surprising - science is surrounded by an aura of perfection and
so it is easy to think that focusing on the core scientific essence (and leaving out everything)
else is the right way of looking at programming languages.</p>

<p>However this leaves out many things that make programming languages interesting. I believe that one
way to fill the missing gap is to look at philosophy of science, which can help us understand how
programming language research is done and how it should be done. I wrote about the general idea
<a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/philosophy-pl/">in a blog post (and essay) last year</a>. Today, I want to talk about one specific topic: <em>What
is the meaning of types?</em></p>

<p>This blog post is a shorter (less philosophical and more to the point) version of an essay that
I submitted to <a href="http://2015.splashcon.org/track/onward2015-essays">Onward! Essays 2015</a>. If you want to get a quick peek at the ideas in the
essay, then continue reading here! If you want to read the full essay (or save it for later),

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/announcing-fslab/index.html">Announcing FsLab: Data science package for Mono and .NET</a></h1>
  <img src="http://fslab.org/img/logos/fslab.png" style="width:120px;float:right;margin:10px" />

<p>After over a year of working on FsLab and talking about it at conferences, it is finally time 
for an official announcement. So, today, I'm excited to announce <a href="http://www.fslab.org">FsLab</a> -
a cross-platform package for doing data science with .NET and Mono.</p>

<p>It is probably not necessary to explain why data science is an important area. We live 
surrounded by information, but extracting useful knowledge from the vast amounts of data is 
not an easy task. You have to access data in different formats (JSON-based REST services, XML, 
CSV files or even HTML tables), you need to deal with missing values, combine and align data 
from multiple sources and then build visualizations (or reports) to tell the right story.</p>

<p>The goal of FsLab is to make this process easier. FsLab combines the power of F# type providers,
the efficiency and robustness of Mono and .NET and the high quality engineering of the 
open-source ecosystem around F# and C#.</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/restricting-ranges/index.html">Comparing date range handling in C# and F#</a></h1>
  <p>I was recently working on some code for handling date ranges in 
<a href="http://github.com/blueMountainCapital/Deedle">Deedle</a>. Although Deedle is written in F#, 
I also wrote some internal integration code in C#. After doing that, I realized that the 
code I wrote is actually reusable and should be a part of Deedle itself and so I went through
the process of rewriting a simple function from (fairly functional) C# to F#. This is a small
(and by no means representative!) example, but I think it nicely shows some of the reasons why
I like F#, so I thought I'd share it.</p>

<p>One thing that we are adding to Deedle is a "BigDeedle" implementation of internal data 
structures. The idea is that you can load very big frames and series without actually loading
all data into memory.</p>

<p>When you perform slicing on a large series and then merge some of the parts of the series
(say, years 2010, 2012 and 2014), you end up with a series that combines a
couple of chunks. If you then restrict the series (say, from June 2012 to June 2014), you
need to restrict the ranges of the chunks:</p>

<img src="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/restricting-ranges/drawing.png" alt="Demonstration" style="margin:15px; width:370px" />

<p>As the diagram shows, this is just a matter of iterating over the chunks, keeping those 
in the range, dropping those outside of the range and restrictingthe boundaries of the other
chunks. So, let's start with the C# version I wrote.</p>

  <h1><a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/query-translation/index.html">Writing custom F# LINQ query builder</a></h1>
  <p>One of the attendees of my <a href="http://www.fsharpworks.com/workshops/finance.html">virtual F# in Finance course</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/stuart_j_davies">Stuart</a> recently asked me a pretty advanced question about writing custom queries with F#, because he was 
interested in writing a nicer querying library for Amazon DynamoDB (his <a href="https://github.com/stuartjdavies/FSharp.Cloud.AWS/blob/master/FSharp.Cloud.AWS/DynamoDB.fs">project is here</a>).</p>

<p>I realized that I don't really know about any good resource about doing this, so I wrote a little sample
that shows how you can do this. The idea is that we want to be able to write something like this:</p>

<table class="pre"><tr><td class="lines"><pre class="fssnip">
<span class="l">1: </span>

<p>The <code>DynamoDB</code> could even be a type generated by a type provider (with all the tables available in Dynamo DB).
Now, the above example uses the built-in <code>query</code> builder, which is extensible, but, as far as I know, you have to 
use LINQ expression trees to support it. In this article, I'm going to use an alternative approach with custom
builder (so you would write <code>dynamo { ... }</code> instead of <code>query { ... }</code>).</p>

<p>I wanted to write a minimal example showing how to do this, so this blog post is going to be mostly code 
(unlike my other chatty articles!), but it should give you (and Stuart :-)) some idea how to do this. 
I was quite intrigued by the idea of having a nice query language for DynamoDB, so I'm hoping that this
blog post can help move the project forward!</p>
