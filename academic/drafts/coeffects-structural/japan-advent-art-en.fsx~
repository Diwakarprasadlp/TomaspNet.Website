For the last few years, the Japanese F# community has been running the F#
Advent Calendar
([2010](http://atnd.org/events/10685),
[2011](http://partake.in/events/1c24993a-c475-4fc2-bca4-7a1cd2f81869),
[2012](http://atnd.org/events/33927)
and also [this year](http://connpass.com/event/3935/)).
Each advent day, one person writes an article about something interesting in F#.
I have been following the advent calendar last year on Twitter and when
the planning started for this year, I offered to write an article too.
A number of people helped to make this happen - [@@igeta](https://twitter.com/igeta)
arranged everything and helped with reviewing, [@@yukitos](http://twitter.com/yukitos)
translated the article and [@@gab_km](http://twitter.com/gab_km) reviewed the translation.
Thanks!

But what should I write about? It would be nice to look at some of the F# open-source libraries
and projects that have been developing over the last year in the F# community. At the same time,
can I relate the topic of the article to Japan? After some thinking, I came up with the following
plan:

 * First, we'll use the [F# Data][fsdata] library and the [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com) to learn
   something about Japanese art. I should add that thanks to [@@yukitos](https://twitter.com/yukitos) the library now also has 
   a [documentation in Japanese][fsdatajp].

 * Then we'll pick one art work and try to recreate it in F#. Given my artistic skills, this 
   part will definitely fail, but we can try :-).

 * Finally, we'll use the [FunScript project](http://funscript.info) to turn our F# code into
   JavaScript, so that we can run it as a pure HTML web application that also works on mobile
   phones and other devices.
