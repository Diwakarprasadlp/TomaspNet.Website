Combining philosophy and computer science might appear a bit odd. The disciplines have very little
overlap. Both philosophers and computer scientists get taught formal logic at some point in their
undergraduate courses, but that's probably as close as they get.

But the fact that the disciplines do not overlap much might very well be the reason why putting them
together is interesting. In an article about [Design and Science](http://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/designandscience),
Joichi Ito (from MIT Media Lab), describes the term _antidisciplinary_ and nicely
summarizes why looking at such unusual combinations is worthwhile:

> Interdisciplinary work is when people from different disciplines work together. But
> *antidisciplinary* is something very different; it's about working in spaces that
> simply do not fit into any existing academic discipline.

> [When focusing on disciplines, it] takes more and more effort and resources to make a

> risky, it (...) requires fewer resources to try promising, unorthodox
> approaches; and provides the potential to have tremendous impact (...).

As you can see from some of my [earlier blog posts](http://tomasp.net/blog/tag/philosophy/),
I think the space between philosophy and computer science is an interesting area. In this article,
I'll explain why. Unlike some of the previous posts (about [miscomputation](http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/failures/index.html),
[types](http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/against-types/index.html) and [philosophy of
science](http://tomasp.net/blog/2014/philosophy-pl/index.html)), this post is quite broad and
does not go into much detail.

At the danger of sounding like a collection of random rants, I look at a number of
questions that arise when you look at computer science from the philosophical perspective,
but I won't attempt to answer them. You can see this article as a research proposal too -
and I hope to write more about some of the questions in the future.
I wish antidisciplinary work was more common and I believe looking
into such questions could have the tremendous impact that Joichi Ito mentioned.
