Some people in the F# community have reputation for traveling too much. I do not know how that is
possible, but as it happens, I will be visiting a couple of places in June and doing a number of
talks, workshops and courses. So, if you are thinking about getting into F#, web development with
F# using the [amazing Suave library](http://suave.io), playing with the new trendy F# to JavaScript
compiler [called Fable](http://fsprojects.github.io/Fable), or learning about the recent
features in [FsLab and Ionide](https://twitter.com/fslaborg/status/728397249697488896), then

The map includes all my travels, but not all of the pins are for F# events. I'm visiting Prague
just to see my family (even though there is a [new awesome F# meetup there](http://www.fsharping.cz))
and my stop in Paris is attending [Symposium for the History and Philosophy of
Programming](http://www.hapoc.org/hapop3) (although we might still do something with the local F#
group too).
