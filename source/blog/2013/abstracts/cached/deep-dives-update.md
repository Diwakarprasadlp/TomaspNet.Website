<p>It has been some time since I <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/manning-deep-dives.aspx/">last wrote about F# Deep Dives</a>
- a new project that I'm working on together with <a href="http://www.manning.com">Manning</a>,
<a href="http://trelford.com/blog">Phil Trelford</a> and a number of F# experts, so I'd like to write a quick
update. In summary, working on a book with more than 10 co-authors is more difficult than one
would think (and 10 people cannot write a book in 1/10 of the time :-)), but now that the holidays
are almost over, you can expect more frequent updates again!</p>

<p>First of all, I should mention that you can buy <a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek2/">the Early Access preview</a>
of the book from Manning and there is already one <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2013/01/05/Review+In+Advance+F+Deep+Dives.aspx">in advance review of the book</a>
from Ted Neward (thanks!) who says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As of this writing, the early-access [...] version had only Chapters 3 and Chapter 11, 
but the other topics [...] are juicy and meaty. [T]he prose from the MEAP edition is 
pretty easy to read already, despite the fact that it's early-access material. In particular, 
the Markdown parser they implement in chapter 3 is a great example of a non-trivial 
language parser, which is not an easy task (...).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I mentioned, the book is unique in that it is not written just by me and Phil - each chapter 
is written by a real-world F# expert and many of them use F# in production. The disadvantage is
that they are all busy people, but we have close to half of the planned chapters available already...</p>
