Since I [submitted my PhD thesis in December](https://twitter.com/tomaspetricek/status/544531884030840832),
I had a little bit of time to finish some of the things that I wanted to do for a really long time, but
never quite found time to actually do them. This included [getting the R provider to work on 
Mac](http://bluemountaincapital.github.io/FSharpRProvider/mac-and-linux.html) and also creating a new 
web site for my various functional programming trainings and books. I even have a nice domain name:

 - **[www.functional-programming.net](http://www.functional-programming.net)**

The page also discusses a couple of business reasons for looking into functional programming. So, if you're
a business person wondering why you should send your developers on an F# course, the site has the answers
for you too! (Or if you are developer and need a page for your boss.) The other place to check out is the
official [F# Software Foundation web page](http://www.fsharp.org) is another great resource and the
[testimonials hosted there](http://fsharp.org/testimonials/).

The page has some information about the [various trainings we're offering at fsharpWorks](http://functional-programming.net/#trainings)
and about the two F# books I co-authored ([Real-World Functional Programming](http://functional-programming.net/rwfp/) and 
brand new [F# Deep Dives](http://functional-programming.net/deepdives/)). 
I'm happy that we can offer some special deals on both the books and the F# FastTrack course in London, 
so if you're considering getting into F#, now is a good time!
