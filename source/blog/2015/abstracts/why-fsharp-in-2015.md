I guess that it might be a bit too late for adding to your list of new year's resulution now.
But just if you still have an empty slot (or in case an originally taken slot has become
available), your new year's resolution should be to get involved with F#!

Obviously, the goal of this blog post is to sell you some of my F# trainings and other materials -
including the online course on [F# in Finance](http://fsharpworks.com/workshops/finance.html) and our
[FastTrack to F#](http://fsharpworks.com/workshops/fast-track.html) course in London and New York
and also the [F# Deep Dives](http://manning.com/petricek2) book. But to conceal this fact, I'm
going to fill most of the blog post with useful information about F#, the F# Software Foundation
and the F# community (but if you really just want to read about my courses, scroll down to the
[second section](http://tomasp.net/blog/2015/why-fsharp-in-2015/index.html#courses)).
