Programming languages are a fascinating area because they combine computer science (and logic) with
many other disciplines including [sociology][socioplt], [human computer interaction][usab] and things
that cannot be scientifically quantified like intuition, taste and (for better or worse) politics.

When we talk about programming languages, we often treat it mainly as scientific discussion seeking
some objective truth. This is not surprising - science is surrounded by an aura of perfection and
so it is easy to think that focusing on the core scientific essence (and leaving out everything)
else is the right way of looking at programming languages.

However this leaves out many things that make programming languages interesting. I believe that one
way to fill the missing gap is to look at philosophy of science, which can help us understand how
programming language research is done and how it should be done. I wrote about the general idea
[in a blog post (and essay) last year][ppl]. Today, I want to talk about one specific topic: _What
is the meaning of types?_

This blog post is a shorter (less philosophical and more to the point) version of an essay that
I submitted to [Onward! Essays 2015][onwess]. If you want to get a quick peek at the ideas in the
essay, then continue reading here! If you want to read the full essay (or save it for later),
you can get [the full version from here][full].
