There are huge amounts of data around us that we could use to better understand the world.
Every company collects large amounts of data about their sales or customers. Governments and
international organizations increasingly release interesting data sets to the public through
various _open government data_ initiatives ([data.gov](http://data.gov) or 
[data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk)). But raw data does not tell you much.

An interesting recent development is _data journalism_. Data journalists tell stories using
data. A data driven article is based on an interesting observation from the data, it includes
(interactive) visualizations that illustrate the point and it often allows the reader to get
the raw data.

Adding a chart produced in, say, Excel to an article is easy, but building good interactive
visualization is much harder. Ideally, the data driven article should not be just text with
static pictures, but a _program_ that links the original data source to the visualization.
This lets readers explore how the data is used, update the content when new data is available
and change parameters of the visualization if they need to understand different aspect of the
topic.

This is in short what I'm trying to build with [The Gamma project](http://thegamma.net). If
you're interested in building better reports or data driven articles, continue reading!

Are you a data journalist or data analyst? We're looking for early partners!
I joined the <a href="http://www.joinef.com" title="Nothing to do with Entity Framework, don't worry!">EF
programme</a> to work on this and if the project sounds like something you'd like to see happen,
<a href="mailto:tomas@tomasp.net">please get in touch</a> or share your contact details
on [The Gamma page](http://thegamma.net)!
