I was fortunate enough to make it to the Microsoft MVP summit this year. I didn't learn anything 
secret (and even if I did, I wouldn't tell you!) but one thing I did learn is that there is a lot
of interest in data science and machine learning both inside Microsoft and in the MVP community.
What was less expected and more exciting was that there was also a lot of interest in F#, which 
is a perfect fit for both of these topics!

When I visited Microsoft back in May to talk about [Scalable Machine Learning and Data Science 
with F#](http://tpetricek.github.io/Talks/2015/scalable-ml-ds-fsharp/redmond/) at an internal event, 
I ended up chatting with the organizer about F# and we agreed that it would be nice to do more
on F#, which is how we ended up organizing the [F# + ML |> MVP Summit 2015](http://fsharpworks.com/mvp-summit/2015.html)
mini-conference on the Friday after the summit.
