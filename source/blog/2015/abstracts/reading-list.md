When I tell my fellow computer scientists or software developers that I'm interested in 
_philosophy of science_, they first look a bit confused, then we have a really interesting 
discussion about it and then they ask me for some interesting books they could read about it.
Given that Christmas is just around the corner and some of the readers might still be looking
for a good present to get, I thought that now is the perfect time to turn my answer into a
blog post!

So, what is philosophy of science about? In summary, it is about trying to better understand 
science. I'll keep using the word _science_ here, but I think _engineering_ would work equally
well. As someone who recently spent a couple of years doing a PhD on programming language theory,
I find this extremely important for computer science (and programming). How can we make better
programming languages if we do not know what _better_ means? And what do we mean when we talk
about very basic concepts like _types_ or programming _errors_?

Reading about philosophy of science inspired me to write a couple of essays on some of the 
topics above including [What can programming language research learn from the philosophy of science?](/blog/2014/philosophy-pl/) and two essays that discuss the [nature of types in programming languages](/blog/2015/against-types/) and also
the nature of [errors and miscomputations](/blog/2015/failures/). This blog post lists some of
the interesting books that I've read and that influenced my thinking (not just) when writing the
aforementioned essays.
