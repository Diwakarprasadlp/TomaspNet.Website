After over a year of working on FsLab and talking about it at conferences, it is finally time 
for an official announcement. So, today, I'm excited to announce [FsLab](http://www.fslab.org) -
a cross-platform package for doing data science with .NET and Mono.

It is probably not necessary to explain why data science is an important area. We live 
surrounded by information, but extracting useful knowledge from the vast amounts of data is 
not an easy task. You have to access data in different formats (JSON-based REST services, XML, 
CSV files or even HTML tables), you need to deal with missing values, combine and align data 
from multiple sources and then build visualizations (or reports) to tell the right story.

The goal of FsLab is to make this process easier. FsLab combines the power of F# type providers,
the efficiency and robustness of Mono and .NET and the high quality engineering of the 
open-source ecosystem around F# and C#.
