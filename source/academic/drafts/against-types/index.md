# Against the definition of types

> Tomas Petricek

> Draft - Submitted to Onward! Essays, 2015
  
_"What is the definition of type?"_ Having a clear and precise answer to this question would 
avoid many misunderstandings and prevent meaningless discussions that arise from them. But 
having such clear and precise answer to this question would also hurt science, "hamper the growth 
of knowledge" and "deflect the course of investigation into narrow channels of things already 
understood". 

In this essay, I argue that not everything we work with needs to be precisely defined. I explore 
how the meaning of types is understood in programming language communities, how the meaning 
changes and why this is good for science and, finally, how can we think about this imprecise 
notion of 'types'.
