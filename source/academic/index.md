# Tomas Petricek @@ [Computer Lab](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk)

I recently submitted my PhD thesis at [Computer Laboratory](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk) at the 
[University of Cam­bridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk), but I'm still a member of the [Programming, 
Logic and Semantics Group](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/pls). My supervisors were
[Alan Mycroft](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~am21/) from the Computer Lab and 
[Don Syme](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/dsyme/). 
Before joining the Computer Laboratory, I studied at the [Faculty of Mathematics and 
Physics](http://www.mff.cuni.cz) in Prague and I did two internships at Microsoft Research. 
I also did an internship at BlueMountain Capital, working on [data science library Deedle](http://bluemountaincapital.github.io/Deedle).

I'm an active member of the F# community, I often speak at [various industry 
events and user groups](http://lanyrd.com/profile/tomasp/), I wrote 
[a book about F#](http://www.manning.com/petricek) and I have a blog. 
For my work in the industry, see [my professional home page](http://tomasp.net).

### Theory of coeffects

<div>
<img src="@Model.Root/academic/img/coeffects.png" title="Typing rule for coeffect systems" 
  style="float:right;margin:5px 0px 5px 5px" />
</div>

I believe that tracking what applications _require_ from the environment in which they 
run is perhaps more important than tracking how they _affect_ the environment. 

In a modern 
application, the environment includes services called, resources, system capabilities, 
and so on. Yet, most existing research focuses on the second problem. Coeffects attempt 
to provide the missing piece of the puzzle.

### Data science

<img src="@Model.Root/academic/img/fsdata.png" title="Accessing JSON with JSON type provider" style="float:right;margin:5px 0px 5px 5px" />

Data science opens many interesting questions for programming languages. How do we make
data easily accessible? How do we provide safety guarantees for code that is often very 
dynamic and interactive? 

I contributed to F# type providers which address accessing the data and some of my current
work fits in the general "data science" theme.

### Philosophy of science

Programming is becoming increasingly important for understanding the world around us
and we need to look at programming languages not just from a narrow technical 
perspective.

To fill the gap, I'm interested in applying ideas from philosophy of science
to work in programming languages. This includes asking questions about their nature 
and understanding how programming language research is done in scientific practice.

 * Start with [What can Programming Language Research  Learn from the Philosophy 
   of Science?](@Model.Root/academic/papers/philosophy-pl/)

### F# theory & practice

<img src="@Model.Root/academic/img/match.png" title="Concurrent, parallel and reactive programming with joinads" style="float:right;margin:5px 0px 5px 5px" />

I'm interested in bridging the gap between theory and practice in functional programming.
I wrote a book Real-World Functional Programming that explains F# from a perspective of
.NET developer and I [teach F# in the industry](http://www.functional-programming.net/).

I worked on _computation expressions_ in F#, both by developing the theory 
(PADL'14) and by making them more relevant (Joinads).

## Recent publications

#### **[September 2015]** [Against a Universal Definition of 'Type'](@Model.Root/academic/papers/against-types/)
 
 > Tomas Petricek. In Proceedings of Onward! Essays 2015
 
 _What is the definition of type?_ Having a clear and precise answer to this question would 
 avoid many misunderstandings but it would hurt science, "hamper the growth of knowledge" and 
 "deflect the course of investigation into narrow channels of things already understood".

#### **[April 2015]** [In the Age of Web: Typed Functional-First Programming Revisited](@Model.Root/academic/papers/age-of-web/)

> Tomas Petricek, Don Syme. In Post-proceedings of ML 2014

Most programming languages were designed before the age of web. This matters because the web 
changes many assumptions that typed functional language designers take for granted. 
In this paper, we present how F# language and libraries face the challenges posed by the web.

#### [Coeffects: A calculus of context-dependent computation](@Model.Root/academic/papers/structural/)

> Tomas Petricek, Dominic Orchard and Alan Mycroft. In Proceedings of ICFP 2014

We present a general calculus for tracking contextual properties of computations, 
including per-variable properties (usage patterns, caching requirements) and 
whole-context properties (platform version, rebindable resources). This resolves
questions that were left unanswered in the ICALP 2013 paper below.

#### [What can Programming Language Research  Learn from the Philosophy of Science?](@Model.Root/academic/papers/philosophy-pl/)

> Tomas Petricek. In Proceedings of AISB 2014

This essay looks how theories from philosophy of science apply
to programming language research. I argue that it is important to clearly state research 
programme, avoid early over-emphasis on precision and I consider how to produce truly reusable
experiments.

#### [The F# Computation Expression Zoo](@Model.Root/academic/papers/computation-zoo/)

> Tomas Petricek and Don Syme. In Proceedings of PADL 2014.

F# computation expressions F# provide a _uniform_ syntax for computations such as
monads, monad transformers and applicative functors. The syntax is _adaptable_ and 
close to built-in language features of Python and C#. This article provides the details
shows that the right syntax can often be determined by considering laws.

## Papers published previously

#### [Coeffects: Unified static analysis of context-dependence](@Model.Root/academic/papers/coeffects/)

> Tomas Petricek, Dominic Orchard and Alan Mycroft. In Proceedings of ICALP 2013.

Effects capture how computations _affect_ the environment, coeffects capture the
_requirements_ that computations place on the environment. We present a unified 
coeffect system that can be used for checking liveness and properties of 
data-flow or distributed programs,

#### [Evaluation strategies for monadic computations](@Model.Root/academic/papers/malias/)

> Tomas Petricek. In Proceedings of MSFP 2012.

When translating pure functional code to a monadic version, we need to use different translation depending
on the desired evaluation strategy. In this paper, we present an unified translation that is parameterized by
an operation <code>malias</code>. We also show how to give <em>call-by-need</em> translation for certain
monads.

#### [Extending Monads with Pattern Matching](@Model.Root/academic/papers/docase/)

> Tomas Petricek, Alan Mycroft and Don Syme. In Haskell Symposium 2011.

The paper introduces a `docase` notation for Haskell that can be used for any monad that 
provides additional operations representing parallel composition, choice and aliasing. We require the 
operations to form a near-semiring, which gurantees that the notation resembles pattern matching.

#### [Joinads: a retargetable control-flow construct for reactive, parallel and concurrent programming](@Model.Root/academic/papers/joinads/)

> Tomas Petricek and Don Syme. In Proceedings of PADL 2011.

Reactive, parallel and concurrent programming models are often difficult to encode in 
general-purpose programming languages. We present a lightweight language extension based on 
pattern matching that can be used for encoding a wide range of these models.

#### [The F# Asynchronous Programming Model](@Model.Root/academic/papers/async/)

> Don Syme, Tomas Petricek and Dmitry Lomov. In PADL 2011.

We describe the asynchronous programming model in F#, and its applications. It combines a core 
language with a non-blocking modality to author lightweight asynchronous tasks. This allows smooth 
transitions between synchronous and asynchronous code and eliminates the inversion of control.

 - [abstract](@Model.Root/academic/papers/async/) | [cite](@Model.Root/academic/papers/async/#cite) |
   [paper](@Model.Root/academic/papers/async/async.pdf)

#### [Collecting Hollywood's Garbage: Avoiding Space-Leaks in Composite Events](@Model.Root/academic/papers/hollywood/)

> Tomas Petricek and Don Syme. In Proceedings of ISMM 2010.

The article discusses memory leaks that can occur in a reactive programming model based on events. 
It presents a formal garbage collection algorithm that could be used in this scenario and a 
correct reactive library based on this idea, implemented in F#.

#### [Encoding monadic computations in C# using iterators](@Model.Root/academic/papers/iterators/)

> Tomas Petricek. In Proceedings of ITAT 2009

The paper shows how to encode certain monadic computations (such as a continuation monad
for asynchronus programming) using the iterator language feature in C# 2.0.

## Articles and reports

#### [Fun with Parallel Monad Comprehensions](@Model.Root/academic/articles/comprefun/)

> Tomas Petricek. The Monad.Reader Issue 18.

The article presents several monads that can benefit from the _parallel monad comprehension_
notation that is supported in the re-designed monad comprehension syntax in Haskell. The examples
are inspired by the work on joinads and include parsers, parallel and concurrent computations.

 - [details](@Model.Root/academic/articles/comprefun/) | [article](@Model.Root/academic/articles/comprefun/comprefun.pdf) | [online](http://tomasp.net/blog/comprefun.aspx/)

#### [F# Web Tools: Rich client/server web applications in F#](@Model.Root/academic/articles/fswebtools/)

> Tomas Petricek. Unpublished draft, 2007

This paper presents one of the first "Ajax" programming frameworks that let you develop 
integrated client/server applications in an integrated way using a single language. The 
framework lets you use F# on both sides and provides a smooth integration between client
and server-side code.

#### [Effect and coeffect type systems](@Model.Root/academic/theses/first-year/first-year.pdf)

> Tomas Petricek. First year report, Computer Laboratory.

The research goal discussed in the report is to use types in an ML-style language to track
additional properties of computations including various kinds of effects (communication, memory access)
and coeffects (how a computation depends on a context). The document briefly summarizes the work
done during the first-year (including the work on _joinads_ and _coeffects_) and
it proposes future research projects.

## Theses and older projects

#### [Reactive programming with events](@Model.Root/academic/theses/events)

> Master thesis. Charles University in Prague, 2010

The thesis uses early version of joinad langauge extension for F# and garbage collection
for events. Based on these concepts, it builds a simple reactive library for F# that allows
writing reactive computations in both control-flow and data-flow styles.

#### [Client-side scripting using meta-programming](@Model.Root/academic/theses/webtools) 

> Bachelor thesis. Charles University in Prague, 2007

The thesis presents a web development framework for F# that automatically splits a single F# 
program with monadic modality annotations into client-side JavaScript and server-side ASP.NET
application.

Start here if you want to know that I'm currently working on and what I recently 
completed. Unpublished drafts are marked as such and I'm always looking for feedback!

#### Draft: [F# Data: Making structured data first-class citizens](@Model.Root/academic/drafts/fsharp-data/)

> Tomas Petricek, Gustavo Guerra, Don Syme. Submitted to ICFP 2015

This paper presents the F# Data type providers for accessing XML, CSV and JSON data.
The paper discusses the type inference algorithm used by the library and also the 
relativized safety property, which provides guarantees of correctness when the library
is used with representative sample documents.

#### Draft: [Context-aware programming languages (PhD thesis)](@Model.Root/academic/theses/coeffects/)

> Tomas Petricek. Submitted in December 2014

The key point made by this thesis is the realization that an execution environment or a context is 
fundamental for writing modern applications and that programming languages should provide abstractions 
for programming with context and verifying how it is accessed. The thesis summarizes all my work on
coeffects.

#### Draft: [Teaching Functional Programming to Professional .NET Developers](@Model.Root/academic/drafts/fsharp-teaching/)

> Tomas Petricek. In Pre-proceedings of TFPIE 2012.

Functional programming is often taught at universities, but with the recent rise of functional
programming in the industry, it is becoming important to teach functional concepts to experienced
developers. This requires a very different approach.

## Teaching in Prague
As an undergraduate and Master's student at the Charles University in Prague, I 
helped to organize and teach non-compulsory courses.

#### [Programming languages F# and OCaml](http://tomasp.net/materials/mff-fsharp-09/) (English)

> Charles University, Winter 2009/2010

The lecture teaches programming in the ML-family of languages and highlights the mathematical 
foundations of ML languages. As a results students should find it easier to understand many 
mathematical concepts. It also explains advanced F# features such as computation expressions.

#### [WinFX Programming](https://github.com/tpetricek/Documents/tree/master/Archive/WinFX%20(2005-2006)) (Czech)

> Charles University, Summer 2005/2006

A practically oriented seminar about Windows programming using the WinFX framework (now called 
WPF, WCF and WF), which was in beta version in 2006. It discussed graphics, working with data 
and communication between applications (Jointly taught with Vojtech Jakl).
