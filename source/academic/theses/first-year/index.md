# Effect and coeffect type systems (First-year PhD report)

The research goal discussed in the report is to use types in an ML-style language to track
additional properties of computations including various kinds of effects (communication, memory access)
and coeffects (how a computation depends on a context). The document briefly summarizes the work
done during the first-year (including the work on _joinads_ and _coeffects_) and
it proposes future research projects.
